Solution 1 (subquery):

SELECT name "Employee"
FROM Employee e1
WHERE salary > (SELECT e2.salary
                FROM Employee e2
                WHERE e2.id = e1.managerId);
                
Solution 2 (self join):

SELECT e2.name "Employee"
FROM Employee e1
JOIN Employee e2
ON e1.id = e2.managerId
WHERE e2.salary > e1.salary;
